# A quick guide to IDL

# for a comment:
; this is a comment 

# to define a variable:
x = 3
# as an array:
y = [1, 2, 3]

# to print:
print, "x is ", x

# to for loop:
; for i from 0 to 4 in steps of 1, save 2*I to the corresponding row of array a 
FOR i=0, 4 DO a[I] = 2*i 
ENDFOR

# to read data from a file:
file = "filename.dat"
readcol, file

# to plot:
plot, a, z

# to define a function:
FUNCTION name, input1, input2
;
; comments go here
;

out = input1+input2

RETURN, out

END

# to run in command line:
idl
.run file_function

# to create a program:
PRO function, file_dir = file_dir
END

# for a if loop:
; EQ is equals, LE is less than or equal to, GT is greater than, NE is not equal to  
IF (a eq 0) THEN BEGIN
; function goes here
ENDIF ELSE BEGIN
; other option
ENDELSE

# to write fits files:
writefits, name, data
